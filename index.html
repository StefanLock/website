            Hi, I'm Stefan, a DevOps engineer with over a decade of experience collaborating with diverse teams across various industries. I've worked with a wide range of technologies and companies, from SMB to large enterprises, giving me a broad perspective on the DevOps landscape.<br><br>This site serves as a portfolio of my work, a place for knowledge sharing, and a resource for potential employers.  Explore the Projects section to see what I'm currently working on and past projects I'm proud of.  Interestingly enough, this very site began as one of those projects.

            This is not an extensive list but a high level list of core technologies I tend to lean towards when starting a project.

            <p><em>I had the pleasure of working with Stefan when he was part of our Mvision ePO team in McAfee. Great to work with, knowledgeable about automation and always ready to provide help on creating and implementing technical solutions. We already miss his skills and input. He is a person I would gladly collaborate with any day and I would highly recommend him as he will most certainly be a great addition to any technical team.</em></p>

            <p><em>Where do I start, I’ve worked with Stefan on and off over the years and can’t recommend him enough he’s not only a fantastically skilled engineer with a great eye for design and execution he’s also a very approachable and personable employee who knows when to Get things done and when to talk through a issue. 

                He’s always shown a interest in not only furthering his own development but also the development of his peers often challenging the status quo for the betterment of his team and the business. 
                
                Stefan does not shy away from responsibility and actively seeks it out rather than sitting on the sidelines! I’d happily recommend him any day of the week and look forward to the day our paths inevitably cross again. </em></p>
